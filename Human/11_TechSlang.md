  <summary>Example of usage</summary>

  Let's say you're trying to fix a bug in your code. While debugging, you realize you need to update a library. In order to update the library, you need to upgrade your package manager. But to upgrade your package manager, you need to update your OS. So, you end up spending hours on unrelated tasks before returning to the bug, which is the original goal. This is yak shaving.
