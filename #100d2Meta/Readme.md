# #100d2Meta — 100 Days to Meta

This repository documents my 100‑day challenge to earn an offer from Meta. Each day I will study, build skills in coding interview topics, and share public progress. I’ll combine disciplined practice with visible, creative outreach to maximize learning, feedback, and opportunities.

## Dates 

Day 00: `21/09/2025`
Day 100: `29/12/2025`

## Goals
- Land a role at Meta by Day 100.
- Finish two books: Cracking the Coding Interview and System Design Interview (Alex Xu).
- Publish daily short-form updates to LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok.

## Daily Routine
- Study: Read/crack problems from Cracking the Coding Interview.
- Practice: Solve LeetCode‑style questions (DSA + patterns).
- Share: Post a short (60–90s) progress summary and insight.
- Log: Record learnings, problems solved, and next steps in this repo.

## Milestones
- Day 1–9: Establish rhythm (study + LeetCode + daily shorts).
- Day 10: On‑site visibility stunt — sit with CV outside a Meta office with a “Hire Me” banner, live‑solve a few LeetCode problems on laptop (visible in public), and share a recap short.
- Day 11–99: Continue daily grind, mock interviews, system design practice, and networking.
- Day 100: Target outcome — hired by Meta (or concrete next steps with recruiter loop scheduled).

## Content & Tracking
- Platforms: LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, TikTok (cross‑posted daily).
- Repo usage:
  - `logs/day-XXX.md` — brief daily notes (what I studied, problems solved, links).
  - `systems/` — system design notes/diagrams and takeaways.
  - `leetcode/` — selected solutions with explanations.

## Accountability
- Public commitment via daily uploads and logs.
- Weekly reflection: what worked, what to adjust, blockers.

## How to Support
- Share feedback on solutions and system designs.
- Refer relevant Meta roles or offer mock interviews.

Let’s go — consistent daily effort, visible progress, and focused preparation for Meta.
