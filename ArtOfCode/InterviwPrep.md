Testing 
Let's test it up


üõë Watch after time.
`5-10` to test it out.

```python
[]

```
I am compiler 

Line by line because anexity. 
If I found a problem and I fix it.
Write comments near by about the values.

Keep Talking

Max 120 tasks

Make a good list of Solutions

Behavioural questions are more complexity

## Another call with Dan


You can write. You should write. 

Bad question.  Ask one bad question 

I should ask about dublicates. 

# 1 Write down notes/task (not all questiuon asked]
 - no writing in teses 
 - Writing time and space 
# 2 Ask clarification questions
# 3 Propose solutions + write down in short words + time complexity + space complexity
# 4 Ask to code
# 5 Code approved solution with explanation along 
# 6 Perform a dry run with a simple case

+  Listen more.  
Train by hour 


Don't jup to code withoug discussion.  

Don't use other's work thone. 


NO ASSUMPTION - Ask question. 

I missed signature methos. Pay attention 

Verbalie talk through the task. 

Don't is there mistake shou'd I preciede.  


Dry run. To much time for explaining time. 


‚åö time. Time to talk to avoid.  

Timing 

# Write all code together. And made dry Run.  Let's just assume. 


Let's assume this method exist. 


Binary Search =  

–ù–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–∏ –¥–æ–¥–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤—É. –ê –ø–æ—Ç—ñ–º .

```python
Given a sorted array and a number, count how many times this number occurs in the array.

Examples:
array = [1,1,2,5,5,5,7], n=5, output=3   
array = [3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6], n=5, output=3 

# Binary LOw High
# TC: O(logN)
# SC: O(1)


def binarySortedCount(arr,n) -> int:
  lm,rm = 0,len(arr)-1
  
  #Left Min
  l,r = lm,rm
  i = lm
  while i>0 and l!=r:
    i = (r-l)//2 
    num = arr[i]
    if n>num:
      l = i
    elif n<num:
      r =i
    else:
  if lm==rm:
    return 1
  return rm-lm+1

## Dan BFS/DFS/DP

- Number of Islands

-  DP is Recursion + Memorization 

- ‚ùóModule can bee 10000000+7  or 10**9

- `@lru_cache` We use it a lot
