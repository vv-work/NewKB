  # 🤖 Yo, it's time for UnionFind! 🚀

  Alright College Bro, let's dive into UnionFind in Python. 🐍

  UnionFind is like the frat house of algorithms, uniting different elements into epic parties (a.k.a. disjoint sets)!

  It's got two main moves:

  - **🔗 Union**: Combine two parties into one mega party! 🎉

  - **🔍 Find**: Where's the party at? This tells you where! 📍

  We've got some rad classes here in Python:

  - **Node Class** 🎈: It's like that one friend in every party, always connected to someone else.

  - **UnionFind Class** 🏦: A collection of disjoint parties. No party crashers here!

  ## 💡 Yo, why Python?

  Cuz Python is great for parties! 🥳 It handles dynamic stuff well and supports fancy party tricks like in-built functions!

  ## 📜 Operation Time!

  Let's party with `uf`, our instance of the `UnionFind` class, and we got 5 pals to start:

  ```python

  uf = UnionFind([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

  ```

  ### 🔐 Union Operation:

  Let’s merge party `1` and party `3`:

  ```python

  uf.union(1, 3)

  ```

  This like when we combine two parties into one. We find which party each pal’s rooting for (their root) and unite them if the roots are different. Always ensuring the
  smaller party joins the bigger one to maintain the balance. No party too big or too small!

  ```python

  def union(self, item1, item2):

      root1 = self.find(self.nodes[item1])

      root2 = self.find(self.nodes[item2])

      if root1 != root2:

          if root1.rank < root2.rank:

              root1, root2 = root2, root1

          # Attach the party with fewer people to the bigger party! 🕺

          root2.parent = root1

          # If both parties were the same size, the party just got bigger!

          if root1.rank == root2.rank:

              root1.rank += 1

  ```

  In our Java buddy's land, it looks a smudge different, but still cool!

  ```java

  public void union(int p, int q) {

      int rootP = find(p);

      int rootQ = find(q);

      if (rootP != rootQ) {

          if (rank[rootP] < rank[rootQ]) {

              parent[rootP] = rootQ;

          } else if (rank[rootP] > rank[rootQ]) {

              parent[rootQ] = rootP;

          } else {

              parent[rootQ] = rootP;

              rank[rootP]++;

          }

      }

  }

  ```

  That's it, compadre! By cleverly merging the smaller party into the bigger one, we keep our 'party tree' balanced, ensuring quick finds and epic unions! 🍺

  ### 🔎 Find Operation:

  You can find which party your pal is at:

  ```python

  uf.find(3)

  ```

  This is an efficient way to find the current party location. If you do it enough times, it’s faster for the next time! (that's the magic of path compression 😉)

  ### ✅ Connected?

  Want to check if two pals are at the same party? We got ya!

  ```python

  uf.connected(1, 2)

  ```

  This will check if `1` and `2` are grooving at the same gig. If not, you can bring them together with a union operation!

  ```python

  uf.union(1, 2)

  uf.connected(1, 2)  # Will return True now

  ```
