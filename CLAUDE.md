# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a personal knowledge base (KB 2.0) containing technical notes, algorithms, and programming resources organized by topic. The repository structure follows these main categories:

- **00_LC_Algo/**: LeetCode algorithms and data structures (arrays, binary search, graphs, etc.)
- **01_Tech_Interview/**: Technical interview resources and code snippets
- **Dev_Syntaxis/**: Programming language syntax and reference (Python, Rust, etc.)
- **OS/**: Operating system commands and setup guides (Linux, Ubuntu, Arch)
- **IDE/**: Development environment configurations (Neovim, Tmux)
- **Unity_ECS.md**: Unity Entity Component System notes and examples
- **cpp.md**: C++ programming notes
- **UE_cpp.md**: Unreal Engine C++ notes

## Common Development Tasks

Since this is primarily a documentation repository, most tasks involve:

- Reading and improving existing markdown files
- Adding code examples and explanations
- Organizing technical notes for better structure
- Adding cross-references between related topics

## File Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive headings with proper markdown hierarchy
- Include code examples with appropriate language syntax highlighting
- Use consistent formatting for technical terms and concepts
- Maintain existing organizational patterns when adding content
- Preserve embedded images and links to external resources

## Key Technical Areas

The repository covers several technical domains:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Game development (Unity ECS, Unreal Engine)
- System programming (C++, Rust)
- Development tools and environments
- Technical interview preparation

When working with files, maintain the existing style and depth of technical detail appropriate for each section.
