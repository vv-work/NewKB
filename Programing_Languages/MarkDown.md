## Markdown Examples for Spoilers and Code

**Spoilers**

Unfortunately, Markdown doesn't have a native way to create spoilers where you can reveal the "Summary" without also viewing the full hidden content. Here are some common approaches:

**1. HTML within Markdown (if supported)**

   ```html
   <details>
   <summary>Spoiler Title</summary>
   This is the hidden content.
   </details>
   ```


**3. Simple Obfuscation**

* **Large blank spaces**
* **Rotating Text (requires special tools)**

**Code Display**

* **Inline Code:** Use `<code>` tags (e.g., `<code>let x = 10;</code>`)
* **Code Blocks:** Use  `<pre>` tags for larger pieces, preserving formatting.

**User Experience Considerations**

* **Clear Labeling:**  Title your spoilers meaningfully so users understand what they'll reveal by expanding the section.
* **Alternatives:** For sensitive spoilers,  consider links to separate pages or warnings if the content might be triggering or off-topic.

**Important:** The `<details>` behavior, where the "Summary" expands to show everything, is how standard HTML works. This offers better accessibility for screen readers.
