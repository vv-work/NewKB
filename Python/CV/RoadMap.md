# CV Roadmap
## OpenCV.

- basic operations on image like pixel editing, geometric transformations, some mathematical tools etc.
- image processing
- feature detectors and descriptors
- Video Analysis
- Machine Learning in image preprocessing
- Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction
- image denoising
- Object Detection and tracking /using openCV/

## Convolutional Neural Networks
- Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
- Deep convolutional models
- Object detection /using CNN/
- Using CNN for generating art and recognizing faces

## Transfer learning

## Image Classification

## Object detection

## OCR. Traditional methods / NN. CNN + LSTM + CTC loss

# Image segmentation. Semantic / Instance Segmentation

# Object tracking

# Generative adversarial networks

# Image Captioning
